# 2D_FE_Global_DIC
Finite-element-based global DIC method (guarantee global kinematic compatibility and decrease noise by adding regularization penalties).  
 
## Prerequisites & Installation
2D_FE_Global_DIC MATLAB code was tested on MATLAB versions later than R2018a. Please download and unzip the code to the MATLAB working path. Then, execute the mail file main_FE_Global_DIC.m.
